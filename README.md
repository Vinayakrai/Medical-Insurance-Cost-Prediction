# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

**Medical Insurance Cost Prediction** is a machine learning project that estimates the cost of medical insurance for individuals based on features such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. This project uses regression models to predict insurance charges.

## 💡 Features

- Predicts insurance charges using regression algorithms.
- Performs data preprocessing including encoding and scaling.
- Visualizes feature correlations and distributions.
- Evaluates model performance using MAE, RMSE, and R².

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- **Required Libraries**:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vinayakrai/Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction.git
cd Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
```

2. **Open the Notebook**:

Open `Medical_Insurance_Cost_Prediction.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or any IDE that supports notebooks.

## 🚀 Usage

- Load and inspect the dataset (`insurance.csv`).
- Preprocess the data (label encoding, normalization).
- Train a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression).
- Evaluate performance and test predictions on new input.
